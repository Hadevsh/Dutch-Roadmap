# Week 1 - Basics

### Lesson 1: Dutch Alphabet and Pronunciation
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn the Dutch alphabet.
-   Practice pronouncing unique Dutch sounds, like _g_ and _ui_.
-   Familiarize yourself with vowels and consonants that differ from your native language.

The Dutch alphabet has 26 letters, just like English. However, the pronunciation differs for several letters. Here's the full alphabet with Dutch pronunciation:

| Letter | Dutch Pronunciation Example | English Equivalent |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| A | _aa_ as in "father" | a |
| B | _b_ as in "bed" | b |
| C | _s_ before e/i, _k_ otherwise | c |
| D | _d_ as in "dog" | d |
| E | _e_ as in "bed" or "uh" | e |
| F | _f_ as in "fine" | f |
| G | Guttural sound like clearing the throat, _ch_ in Loch | g |
| H | _h_ as in "house" | h |
| I | _ee_ as in "meet" | i |
| J | _y_ as in "yes" | j |
| K | _k_ as in "kite" | k |

| X | _x_ as in "box" | x |
| Y | _ij_ or "i-grec" | y |
| Z | _z_ as in "zoo" | z |

1.  **The G Sound:**
    -   Dutch _g_ is a guttural sound, produced at the back of the throat.
    -   Example: _goed_ (good).
    -   Practice: Say "Loch" (like the Scottish lake) and extend the throat sound.
2.  **The UI Sound:**
    -   The Dutch _ui_ is a blend of _ow_ and _ee_.
    -   Example: _huis_ (house).
    -   Practice: Start with "ow" and quickly blend into "ee."
3.  **The IJ Sound:**
    -   Similar to _ay_ in "day" but slightly sharper.
    -   Example: _ijs_ (ice).

Here are a few simple words to practice:
1.  _Goedemorgen_ (Good morning) – Focus on the guttural _g_.
2.  _Gaan_ (To go)
3.  _Graag_ (With pleasure)
5.  _Huis_ (House) – Practice the _ui_ sound.
6.  _Buik_ (Belly)
7.  _Duim_ (Thumb)
8.  _Ijzer_ (Iron) or _Ijs_ (Ice) – Work on the _ij_ sound.
9.  _Vrij_ (Free)
10.  _Rijden_ (To drive)

Here's also a polite phrase to remember:
-   _Dank je wel_ (Thank you)

Here’s a pronunciation drill:
1.  Listen to native speakers pronouncing words on [Forvo](https://forvo.com/).
2.  Repeat after them, paying attention to the sounds of _g_, _ui_, and _ij_.

**Wrap-up**
-   Practice saying the alphabet out loud twice.

### Lesson 2: Greetings and Common Phrases
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn and practice common Dutch greetings and polite expressions.
-   Build confidence in starting basic conversations.
-   Familiarize yourself with polite and informal speech.

When learning a language, greetings are the gateway to connecting with others. Dutch greetings are straightforward, but they also reflect the culture. For instance, in informal situations, people often say _Hallo!_ or _Hoi!_ with a smile, while in formal settings, you might use _Goedemiddag!_ or _Hoe maakt u het?_ Politeness is appreciated, so knowing how to say _Dank je wel!_ (Thank you!) or _Alstublieft_ (Please) can make a great impression.

Below is a table summarizing key greetings and polite expressions you’ll encounter in daily Dutch conversations.

| Dutch Phrase | English Translation | When To Use |
| -- | -- | -- |
| _Hallo!_ | Hello! | Informal or casual settings. |
| _Hoi!_ | Hi! | Very informal, with friends or family. |
| _Goedemorgen!_ | Good morning! | Until 12:00 PM. |
| _Goedemiddag!_ | Good afternoon! | 12:00–6:00 PM. |
| _Goedenavond!_ | Good evening! | After 6:00 PM. |
| _Hoe gaat het?_ | How are you? | Informal; everyday conversations. |
| _Hoe maakt u het?_ | How are you? (formal) | Formal; e.g., meeting someone older. |
| _Tot ziens!_ | Goodbye! | Neutral/formal farewell. |
| _Doei!_ | Bye! | Informal farewell. |
| _Dank je wel!_ | Thank you! (informal) | Everyday gratitude. |
| _Dank u wel!_ | Thank you! (formal) | Formal gratitude. |

Take a moment to say each phrase aloud. Pay attention to how _goedemorgen_ has the guttural _g_ sound, while _hoi_ is softer and more casual.

In Dutch culture, being polite is key, especially when asking for help or addressing someone formally. Here's a list of polite expressions to expand your conversational toolkit:

| Dutch Phrase | English Translation | Context |
| -- | -- | -- |
| _Alstublieft._ | Please. (forma) | Offering or requesting politely. |
| _Alsjeblieft._ | Please. (informal) | Same as above, but casual. |
| _Ik heet..._ | My name is... | Introducing yourself. |
| _Aangenaam kennis te maken._ | Nice to meet you. | Formal introductions, especially professionally. |
| _Ik kom uit…_ | I am from… | Sharing your place of origin. |
| _Kunt u mij helpen?_ | Can you help me? (formal) | Requesting assistance politely. |
| _Waar is de…?_ | Where is the…? | Asking for directions or objects. |

Let’s simulate a simple conversation that uses these phrases. Repeat it aloud several times, playing both roles:

**Willem:** Goedemorgen! Hoe gaat het?  
**Noah:** Goed, dank je wel! En met jou? 
**Willem:** Ook goed, dank je. Hoe heet je?
**Noah:** Ik heet Noah, en jij?
**Willem:** Mijn naam is Willem, aangenaam en tot ziens! 
**Noah:** Doei!

Learn these 10 additional words to help with conversations:
1.  _Ja_ (Yes)
2.  _Nee_ (No)
3.  _Misschien_ (Maybe)
4.  _Sorry_ (Sorry)
5.  _Excuseer me_ (Excuse me)
6.  _Nu_ (Now)
7.  _Later_ (Later)
8.  _Vandaag_ (Today)
9.  _Meneer_ (Mr.)
10.  _Mevrouw_ (Mrs./Ms.)

**Wrap-up**
-   Review today’s phrases and vocabulary out loud.
-   Try creating your own short dialogue and practice saying it with confidence.
-   Reflect on what you’ve learned: Did you find the formal and informal phrases clear?

### Lesson 3: Numbers and Days of the Week
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn how to count from 1 to 20 and understand the basics of Dutch numbering.
-   Familiarize yourself with the names of the days of the week and their pronunciation.
-   Practice using numbers and days in sentences to develop fluency.

Dutch numbers are often similar to English ones, but pronunciation can be tricky for beginners. Here’s a guide to the numbers from 1 to 20:

| Number | Dutch | Pronunciation |
| ------ | ----- | ------------- |
| 1 | _Eén_ | "Ayn" |
| 2 | _Twee_ | "Tway" |
| 3 | _Drie_ | "Dree" |
| 4 | _Vier_ | "Veer" |
| 5 | _Vijf_ | "Fayf" |
| 6 | _Zes_ | "Zes" |
| 7 | _Zeven_ | "ZAY-ven" |
| 8 | _Acht_ | "Acht" (with guttural 'ch') |
| 9 | _Negen_ | "NAY-ghen" |
| 10 | _Tien_ | "Teen" |
| 11 | _Elf_ | "Elf" |
| 12 | _Twaalf_ | "Twaalf" |
| 13 | _Dertien_ | "DAIR-teen" |
| 14 | _Veertien_ | "VEER-teen" |
| 15 | _Vijftien_ | "FAYF-teen" |
| 16 | _Zestien_ | "ZES-teen" |
| 17 | _Zeventien_ | "ZAY-ven-teen" |
| 18 | _Achttien_ | "Acht-teen" |
| 19 | _Negentien_ | "NAY-ghen-teen" |
| 20 | _Twintig_ | "TWIN-tig" |

**Key Observations:**
1.   Notice the pattern from 13 to 19: the first part of the number (_der, veer, vijf_) corresponds to the base number, followed by _-tien_.
2.   The number 20 (_twintig_) introduces a pattern for higher numbers, where _-tig_ is the suffix for tens (e.g., _dertig_ = 30).

The days of the week in Dutch are similar to Germanic languages and often end in _-dag_. Here’s a table with pronunciation:

| Day | Dutch | Pronunciation | Meaning/Context |
| --- | ----- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Monday | _Maandag_ | "MAHN-dahg" | Derived from the moon (_maan_). |
| Tuesday | _Dinsdag_ | "DINZ-dahg" | Related to the Norse god Tyr. |
| Wednesday | _Woensdag_ | "VOONS-dahg" | "Wodan’s day" (Odin). |
| Thursday | _Donderdag_ | "DON-der-dahg" | Named after Thor (_donder_ = thunder). |
| Friday | _Vrijdag_ | "FRY-dahg" | "Freya’s day" (Norse goddess). |
| Saturday | _Zaterdag_ | "ZAH-ter-dahg" | Refers to Saturn (_zaterdag_). |
| Sunday | _Zondag_ | "ZON-dahg" | "Sun-day" (_zon_ = sun). |

**Key Observations:**
1.   Each day ends with _-dag_ (day), which makes them easier to remember.
2.   The pronunciations are logical but can vary slightly by region.

**Numbers in Context:**
1.   _Ik heb twee appels._ – I have two apples.
2.   _De trein vertrekt om negen uur._ – The train leaves at nine o'clock.
3.   _Ik ben zestien jaar oud._ – I am sixteen years old.

**Days in Context:**
1.   _Vandaag is maandag._ – Today is Monday.
2.   _Ik werk op woensdag._ – I work on Wednesday.
3.   _Het weekend is zaterdag en zondag._ – The weekend is Saturday and Sunday.

**Wrap-up**
-   Review numbers 1–20 and days of the week aloud.

### Lesson 4: Subject Pronouns and the Verbs "Zijn" (To Be) & "Hebben" (To Have)
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn Dutch subject pronouns.
-   Understand the conjugation and use of the two most important Dutch verbs: zijn (to be) and hebben (to have).
-   Practice forming simple sentences using these verbs.

**Why Are Pronouns Important?**
Pronouns replace nouns and make sentences more fluid. Imagine introducing yourself without saying "I" or talking about a friend without saying "he" or "she"—it would be awkward! Learning subject pronouns early helps you form simple and clear Dutch sentences.
**Dutch Subject Pronouns:**
| Dutch	| English |	Pronunciation |
| -- | -- | -- |
| _Ik_ | I | "Ick" |
| _Jij / Je_ | You (informal) |	"Yay" / "Yuh" |
| _U_ | You (formal) | "Oo" |
| _Hij_ | He | "High" |
| _Zij / Ze_ | She | "Zay" / "Zuh" |
| _Wij / We_ | We | "Vay" / "Vuh" |
| _Jullie_ | You (plural) | "Yoo-lee" |
| _Zij / Ze_ | They | "Zay" / "Zuh" |
-   _Jij_ and _Je_ are both informal ways to say "you." _Jij_ is more emphasized, while _Je_ is more casual.
-   _U_ is used for formal situations, such as speaking to strangers or showing respect to elders.
-   _Wij_ vs. _We_ and _Zij_ vs. _Ze_: The first form (_Wij, Zij_) is used for emphasis, while the second (_We, Ze_) is neutral in casual speech.

#### **Quick Exercise**:
Try filling in the correct Dutch pronoun:
-   ...... ben Thomas.
-   ...... zijn in Amsterdam.
-   ...... is mijn vriend.
-   ...... spreken Nederlands.

**Why is "Zijn" Important?**
The verb _zijn_ ("to be") is one of the most commonly used verbs in Dutch. It’s essential for describing people, things, and states of being.
**Conjugation of _Zijn_:**
| Dutch | English |	Example Sentence | Translation |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| _Ik ben_ | I am | _Ik ben gelukkig._ | I am happy. |
| _Jij / Je bent_ | You are | _Jij bent mijn vriend._ | You are my friend. |
| _U bent_ | You are (formal) | _U bent vriendelijk._ | You are friendly. |
| _Hij / Zij is_ | He / She is | _Hij is sterk._ | He is strong. |
| _Wij / We zijn_ | We are | _Wij zijn hier._ | We are here. |
| _Jullie zijn_ | You (plural) are | _Jullie zijn slim._ | You (all) are smart. |
| _Zij / Ze zijn_ | They are | _Zij zijn in Nederland._ | They are in the Netherlands. |

#### **Quick Exercise**:
Fill in the blanks with the correct form of _zijn_:
-   Ik ...... student.
-   Hij ...... in Amsterdam.
-   Wij ...... vrienden.
-   Jij ...... Nederlands.

**Why is _Hebben_ Important?**
The verb _hebben_ ("to have") is crucial because it’s used to express possession and is also an auxiliary verb in forming past tenses.
**Conjugation of _Hebben_:**
