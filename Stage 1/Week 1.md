The Dutch alphabet has 26 letters, just like English. However, the pronunciation differs for several letters. Here's the full alphabet with Dutch pronunciation:

| Letter | Dutch Pronunciation Example | English Equivalent |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| A | _aa_ as in "father" | a |
| B | _b_ as in "bed" | b |
| C | _s_ before e/i, _k_ otherwise | c |
| D | _d_ as in "dog" | d |
| E | _e_ as in "bed" or "uh" | e |
| F | _f_ as in "fine" | f |
| G | Guttural sound like clearing the throat, _ch_ in Loch | g |
| H | _h_ as in "house" | h |
| I | _ee_ as in "meet" | i |

1.  **The G Sound:**
    -   Dutch _g_ is a guttural sound, produced at the back of the throat.
    -   Example: _goed_ (good).
    -   Practice: Say "Loch" (like the Scottish lake) and extend the throat sound.
2.  **The UI Sound:**
    -   The Dutch _ui_ is a blend of _ow_ and _ee_.
    -   Example: _huis_ (house).
    -   Practice: Start with "ow" and quickly blend into "ee."
3.  **The IJ Sound:**
    -   Similar to _ay_ in "day" but slightly sharper.
    -   Example: _ijs_ (ice).

Here are a few simple words to practice:
1.  _Goedemorgen_ (Good morning) – Focus on the guttural _g_.
2.  _Gaan_ (To go)
3.  _Graag_ (With pleasure)
5.  _Huis_ (House) – Practice the _ui_ sound.
6.  _Buik_ (Belly)
7.  _Duim_ (Thumb)
8.  _Ijzer_ (Iron) or _Ijs_ (Ice) – Work on the _ij_ sound.
9.  _Vrij_ (Free)
10.  _Rijden_ (To drive)

Here's also a polite phrase to remember:
-   _Dank je wel_ (Thank you)

Here’s a pronunciation drill:
