# Week 1 - Basics

### Lesson 1: Dutch Alphabet and Pronunciation
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn the Dutch alphabet.
-   Practice pronouncing unique Dutch sounds, like _g_ and _ui_.
-   Familiarize yourself with vowels and consonants that differ from your native language.

The Dutch alphabet has 26 letters, just like English. However, the pronunciation differs for several letters. Here's the full alphabet with Dutch pronunciation:

| Letter | Dutch Pronunciation Example | English Equivalent |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| A | _aa_ as in "father" | a |
| B | _b_ as in "bed" | b |
| C | _s_ before e/i, _k_ otherwise | c |
| D | _d_ as in "dog" | d |
| E | _e_ as in "bed" or "uh" | e |
| F | _f_ as in "fine" | f |
| G | Guttural sound like clearing the throat, _ch_ in Loch | g |
| H | _h_ as in "house" | h |
| I | _ee_ as in "meet" | i |
| J | _y_ as in "yes" | j |
| K | _k_ as in "kite" | k |
| L | _l_ as in "light" | l |
| M | _m_ as in "mother" | m |
| N | _n_ as in "nice" | n |
| O | _o_ as in "go" | o |
| P | _p_ as in "pen" | p |
| Q | _q_ as in "queue" | q |
| R | Rolled "r" or slightly guttural | r |
| S | _s_ as in "sun" | s |
| T | _t_ as in "table" | t |
| U | _oo_ as in "loot" | u |
| V | _v_ or _f_ sound | v |
| W | _w_ as in "water" | w |
| X | _x_ as in "box" | x |
| Y | _ij_ or "i-grec" | y |
| Z | _z_ as in "zoo" | z |

1.  **The G Sound:**
    -   Dutch _g_ is a guttural sound, produced at the back of the throat.
    -   Example: _goed_ (good).
    -   Practice: Say "Loch" (like the Scottish lake) and extend the throat sound.
2.  **The UI Sound:**
    -   The Dutch _ui_ is a blend of _ow_ and _ee_.
    -   Example: _huis_ (house).
    -   Practice: Start with "ow" and quickly blend into "ee."
3.  **The IJ Sound:**
    -   Similar to _ay_ in "day" but slightly sharper.
    -   Example: _ijs_ (ice).

Here are a few simple words to practice:
1.  _Goedemorgen_ (Good morning) – Focus on the guttural _g_.
2.  _Gaan_ (To go)
3.  _Graag_ (With pleasure)
5.  _Huis_ (House) – Practice the _ui_ sound.
6.  _Buik_ (Belly)
7.  _Duim_ (Thumb)
8.  _Ijzer_ (Iron) or _Ijs_ (Ice) – Work on the _ij_ sound.
9.  _Vrij_ (Free)
10.  _Rijden_ (To drive)

Here's also a polite phrase to remember:
-   _Dank je wel_ (Thank you)

Here’s a pronunciation drill:
1.  Listen to native speakers pronouncing words on [Forvo](https://forvo.com/).
2.  Repeat after them, paying attention to the sounds of _g_, _ui_, and _ij_.

**Wrap-up**
-   Practice saying the alphabet out loud twice.
-   Focus on mastering the unique sounds by repeating the practice words.
-   Let me know if you have questions or need clarification.

6.  _Zon_ (Sun)
7.  _Kind_ (Child)
8.  _Tafel_ (Table)

-  A woman eats fish.
-  I am happy.

### Lesson 2: Greetings and Common Phrases
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn and practice common Dutch greetings and polite expressions.
-   Build confidence in starting basic conversations.
-   Familiarize yourself with polite and informal speech.

When learning a language, greetings are the gateway to connecting with others. Dutch greetings are straightforward, but they also reflect the culture. For instance, in informal situations, people often say _Hallo!_ or _Hoi!_ with a smile, while in formal settings, you might use _Goedemiddag!_ or _Hoe maakt u het?_ Politeness is appreciated, so knowing how to say _Dank je wel!_ (Thank you!) or _Alstublieft_ (Please) can make a great impression.

Below is a table summarizing key greetings and polite expressions you’ll encounter in daily Dutch conversations.

| Dutch Phrase | English Translation | When To Use |
| -- | -- | -- |
| _Hallo!_ | Hello! | Informal or casual settings. |
| _Hoi!_ | Hi! | Very informal, with friends or family. |
| _Goedemorgen!_ | Good morning! | Until 12:00 PM. |
| _Goedemiddag!_ | Good afternoon! | 12:00–6:00 PM. |
| _Goedenavond!_ | Good evening! | After 6:00 PM. |
| _Hoe gaat het?_ | How are you? | Informal; everyday conversations. |
| _Hoe maakt u het?_ | How are you? (formal) | Formal; e.g., meeting someone older. |
| _Tot ziens!_ | Goodbye! | Neutral/formal farewell. |
| _Doei!_ | Bye! | Informal farewell. |
| _Dank je wel!_ | Thank you! (informal) | Everyday gratitude. |
| _Dank u wel!_ | Thank you! (formal) | Formal gratitude. |

Take a moment to say each phrase aloud. Pay attention to how _goedemorgen_ has the guttural _g_ sound, while _hoi_ is softer and more casual.

In Dutch culture, being polite is key, especially when asking for help or addressing someone formally. Here's a list of polite expressions to expand your conversational toolkit:

| Dutch Phrase | English Translation | Context |
| -- | -- | -- |
| _Alstublieft._ | Please. (forma) | Offering or requesting politely. |
| _Alsjeblieft._ | Please. (informal) | Same as above, but casual. |
| _Ik heet..._ | My name is... | Introducing yourself. |
| _Aangenaam kennis te maken._ | Nice to meet you. | Formal introductions, especially professionally. |
| _Ik kom uit…_ | I am from… | Sharing your place of origin. |
| _Kunt u mij helpen?_ | Can you help me? (formal) | Requesting assistance politely. |
| _Waar is de…?_ | Where is the…? | Asking for directions or objects. |

Let’s simulate a simple conversation that uses these phrases. Repeat it aloud several times, playing both roles:

**Willem:** Goedemorgen! Hoe gaat het?  
**Noah:** Goed, dank je wel! En met jou? 
**Willem:** Ook goed, dank je. Hoe heet je?
**Noah:** Ik heet Noah, en jij?
**Willem:** Mijn naam is Willem, aangenaam en tot ziens! 
**Noah:** Doei!

Learn these 10 additional words to help with conversations:
1.  _Ja_ (Yes)
2.  _Nee_ (No)
3.  _Misschien_ (Maybe)
4.  _Sorry_ (Sorry)
5.  _Excuseer me_ (Excuse me)
6.  _Nu_ (Now)
7.  _Later_ (Later)
8.  _Vandaag_ (Today)
9.  _Meneer_ (Mr.)
10.  _Mevrouw_ (Mrs./Ms.)

**Wrap-up**
-   Review today’s phrases and vocabulary out loud.
-   Try creating your own short dialogue and practice saying it with confidence.
-   Reflect on what you’ve learned: Did you find the formal and informal phrases clear?

#### **Exercises**:
Translate the phrases:
-   _Goedemorgen!_ = ........................
-   _Dank u wel!_ = ........................
-   _Ik heet Anna._ = ........................
-   _Tot ziens!_ = ........................
-   _Waar is de trein?_ = ........................
-   Nice to meet you = ........................
-   I am from the Netherlands = ........................

Complete the sentences with the correct Dutch word or phrase:
-   ........................ ! Ik heet Mark.
-   Hoe ........................ het?
-   Ik kom ........................ Nederland.
-   ........................ kennis te maken!
-   Dank ........................ wel! (informal)

Using at least 5 phrases from the lesson, write a short dialogue between two people meeting for the first time. 
**Thomas:** ........................................................................
**Nora:** ........................................................................
**Thomas:** ........................................................................
**Nora:** ........................................................................
**Thomas:** ........................................................................
**Nora:** ........................................................................
**Thomas:** ........................................................................
**Nora:** ........................................................................
**Thomas:** ........................................................................

### Lesson 3: Numbers and Days of the Week
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn how to count from 1 to 20 and understand the basics of Dutch numbering.
-   Familiarize yourself with the names of the days of the week and their pronunciation.
-   Practice using numbers and days in sentences to develop fluency.

Dutch numbers are often similar to English ones, but pronunciation can be tricky for beginners. Here’s a guide to the numbers from 1 to 20:

| Number | Dutch | Pronunciation |
| ------ | ----- | ------------- |
| 1 | _Eén_ | "Ayn" |
| 2 | _Twee_ | "Tway" |
| 3 | _Drie_ | "Dree" |
| 4 | _Vier_ | "Veer" |
| 5 | _Vijf_ | "Fayf" |
| 6 | _Zes_ | "Zes" |
| 7 | _Zeven_ | "ZAY-ven" |
| 8 | _Acht_ | "Acht" (with guttural 'ch') |
| 9 | _Negen_ | "NAY-ghen" |
| 10 | _Tien_ | "Teen" |
| 11 | _Elf_ | "Elf" |
| 12 | _Twaalf_ | "Twaalf" |
| 13 | _Dertien_ | "DAIR-teen" |
| 14 | _Veertien_ | "VEER-teen" |
| 15 | _Vijftien_ | "FAYF-teen" |
| 16 | _Zestien_ | "ZES-teen" |
| 17 | _Zeventien_ | "ZAY-ven-teen" |
| 18 | _Achttien_ | "Acht-teen" |
| 19 | _Negentien_ | "NAY-ghen-teen" |
| 20 | _Twintig_ | "TWIN-tig" |

**Key Observations:**
1.   Notice the pattern from 13 to 19: the first part of the number (_der, veer, vijf_) corresponds to the base number, followed by _-tien_.
2.   The number 20 (_twintig_) introduces a pattern for higher numbers, where _-tig_ is the suffix for tens (e.g., _dertig_ = 30).

The days of the week in Dutch are similar to Germanic languages and often end in _-dag_. Here’s a table with pronunciation:

| Day | Dutch | Pronunciation | Meaning/Context |
| --- | ----- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Monday | _Maandag_ | "MAHN-dahg" | Derived from the moon (_maan_). |
| Tuesday | _Dinsdag_ | "DINZ-dahg" | Related to the Norse god Tyr. |
| Wednesday | _Woensdag_ | "VOONS-dahg" | "Wodan’s day" (Odin). |
| Thursday | _Donderdag_ | "DON-der-dahg" | Named after Thor (_donder_ = thunder). |
| Friday | _Vrijdag_ | "FRY-dahg" | "Freya’s day" (Norse goddess). |
| Saturday | _Zaterdag_ | "ZAH-ter-dahg" | Refers to Saturn (_zaterdag_). |
| Sunday | _Zondag_ | "ZON-dahg" | "Sun-day" (_zon_ = sun). |

**Key Observations:**
1.   Each day ends with _-dag_ (day), which makes them easier to remember.
2.   The pronunciations are logical but can vary slightly by region.

**Numbers in Context:**
1.   _Ik heb twee appels._ – I have two apples.
2.   _De trein vertrekt om negen uur._ – The train leaves at nine o'clock.
3.   _Ik ben zestien jaar oud._ – I am sixteen years old.

**Days in Context:**
1.   _Vandaag is maandag._ – Today is Monday.
2.   _Ik werk op woensdag._ – I work on Wednesday.
3.   _Het weekend is zaterdag en zondag._ – The weekend is Saturday and Sunday.

**Wrap-up**
-   Review numbers 1–20 and days of the week aloud.
-   Practice forming your own sentences with numbers and days.
-   Reflect on your progress: Are the pronunciation and patterns becoming clearer?

#### **Exercises**:
Translate the words:
-   _Vrijdag_ = ..............
-   _Acht_ = ..............
-   _Zes_ = ..............
-   _Woensdag_ = ..............
-   _Appel_ = ..............
-   _Negentien_ = ..............
-   _Dinsdag_ = ..............
-   _Twintig_ = ..............

\*Fill in the Gaps:
-   Ik ben ........................ jaar oud.
-   De vergadering is op ........................
-   We hebben ........................ minuten om te eten.
-   Vandaag is ........................ en morgen is ........................

### Lesson 4: Subject Pronouns and the Verbs "Zijn" (To Be) & "Hebben" (To Have)
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn Dutch subject pronouns.
-   Understand the conjugation and use of the two most important Dutch verbs: zijn (to be) and hebben (to have).
-   Practice forming simple sentences using these verbs.

**Why Are Pronouns Important?**
Pronouns replace nouns and make sentences more fluid. Imagine introducing yourself without saying "I" or talking about a friend without saying "he" or "she"—it would be awkward! Learning subject pronouns early helps you form simple and clear Dutch sentences.
**Dutch Subject Pronouns:**
| Dutch	| English |	Pronunciation |
| -- | -- | -- |
| _Ik_ | I | "Ick" |
| _Jij / Je_ | You (informal) |	"Yay" / "Yuh" |
| _U_ | You (formal) | "Oo" |
| _Hij_ | He | "High" |
| _Zij / Ze_ | She | "Zay" / "Zuh" |
| _Wij / We_ | We | "Vay" / "Vuh" |
| _Jullie_ | You (plural) | "Yoo-lee" |
| _Zij / Ze_ | They | "Zay" / "Zuh" |
-   _Jij_ and _Je_ are both informal ways to say "you." _Jij_ is more emphasized, while _Je_ is more casual.
-   _U_ is used for formal situations, such as speaking to strangers or showing respect to elders.
-   _Wij_ vs. _We_ and _Zij_ vs. _Ze_: The first form (_Wij, Zij_) is used for emphasis, while the second (_We, Ze_) is neutral in casual speech.

#### **Quick Exercise**:
Try filling in the correct Dutch pronoun:
-   ...... ben Thomas.
-   ...... zijn in Amsterdam.
-   ...... is mijn vriend.
-   ...... spreken Nederlands.

**Why is "Zijn" Important?**
The verb _zijn_ ("to be") is one of the most commonly used verbs in Dutch. It’s essential for describing people, things, and states of being.
**Conjugation of _Zijn_:**
| Dutch | English |	Example Sentence | Translation |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| _Ik ben_ | I am | _Ik ben gelukkig._ | I am happy. |
| _Jij / Je bent_ | You are | _Jij bent mijn vriend._ | You are my friend. |
| _U bent_ | You are (formal) | _U bent vriendelijk._ | You are friendly. |
| _Hij / Zij is_ | He / She is | _Hij is sterk._ | He is strong. |
| _Wij / We zijn_ | We are | _Wij zijn hier._ | We are here. |
| _Jullie zijn_ | You (plural) are | _Jullie zijn slim._ | You (all) are smart. |
| _Zij / Ze zijn_ | They are | _Zij zijn in Nederland._ | They are in the Netherlands. |

#### **Quick Exercise**:
Fill in the blanks with the correct form of _zijn_:
-   Ik ...... student.
-   Hij ...... in Amsterdam.
-   Wij ...... vrienden.
-   Jij ...... Nederlands.

**Why is _Hebben_ Important?**
The verb _hebben_ ("to have") is crucial because it’s used to express possession and is also an auxiliary verb in forming past tenses.
**Conjugation of _Hebben_:**
| Dutch | English |	Example Sentence | Translation |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| _Ik heb_ | I have | _Ik heb een auto._ | I have a car. |
| _Jij / Je hebt_ | You have | _Jij hebt een broer._ | You have a brother. |
| _U heeft_ | You have (formal) | _U heeft een afspraak._ | You have an appointment. |
| _Hij / Zij heeft_ | He / She has | _Hij heeft een boek._ | He has a book. |
| _Wij / We hebben_ | We have | _Wij hebben tijd._ | We have time. |
| _Jullie hebben_ | You (plural) have | _Jullie hebben geld._ | You (all) have money. |
| _Zij / Ze hebben_ | They have | _Zij hebben een hond._ | They have a dog. |

#### **Quick Exercise**:
Fill in the blanks with the correct form of _hebben_:
-   Ik ...... een fiets.
-   Zij ...... een huis.
-   Jij ...... een probleem.
-   Wij ...... vakantie.

**Combining _Zijn_ and _Hebben_ in Sentences**
Now let’s put both verbs into context. Try forming your own sentences using these examples as inspiration:
-  _Ik ben moe, maar ik heb energie nodig._ – I am tired, but I need energy.
-  _Zij is mijn vriendin en zij heeft een kat._ – She is my friend, and she has a cat.
-  _Jullie zijn studenten en jullie hebben veel boeken._ – You all are students, and you have many books.
-  _Hij is ziek, maar hij heeft medicijnen._ – He is sick, but he has medicine.

**Challenge: Translate These Sentences into Dutch**
-  I am happy, but I have a lot of work.
-  They are in the Netherlands and they have a house.
-  You (plural) are smart, and you have good ideas.
-  She is a teacher, and she has a big family.

**Wrap-up**
-   Review aloud: Repeat the conjugations of zijn and hebben.
-   Practice sentences: Try forming 3 new sentences using these verbs.
-   Reflect on what you learned: What was easy? What was challenging?

### Lesson 5: Forming Simple Sentences in Dutch (Word Order & Basic Questions)
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Understand Dutch sentence structure (word order in statements and questions).
-   Learn how to form basic statements, negatives, and questions.
-   Practice creating sentences and asking simple questions.

#### Dutch Sentence Structure
**Why Is Word Order Important?**
Dutch has a specific subject-verb-object (SVO) sentence structure, similar to English. However, it follows strict rules, especially in questions and subordinate clauses. Mastering word order early will make it easier to form correct sentences.

#### **Basic Sentence Structure (SVO)**
A standard Dutch sentence follows this pattern:
**Subject (S) + Verb (V) + Object (O)**
**Example:**
-   _Ik eet een appel._ (**I eat an apple.**)
    -   **_Ik_** = Subject
    -   **_eet_** = Verb
    -   **_een appel_** = Object

**More examples:**
-   _Zij heeft een hond._ (**She has a dog.**)
-   _Wij wonen in Nederland._ (**We live in the Netherlands.**)

**Practice Exercise:**
Rearrange the words to form correct sentences:
-   (een / ik / heb / fiets)
-   (hij / is / student / een)
-   (een / hond / jullie / hebben)

#### **Negative Sentences in Dutch**
To **make a sentence negative**, we use _niet_ (not) or _geen_ (no, none).

#### When to use _niet_?
_Niet_ is placed at the end of the sentence (or before adjectives/adverbs):
-   _Ik ben niet moe._ (**I am not tired.**)
-   _Hij werkt niet in Amsterdam._ (**He does not work in Amsterdam.**)

#### When to use _geen_?
_Geen_ is used to negate a noun when talking about having something:
-   _Ik heb geen auto._ (**I don’t have a car.**)
-   _Hij heeft geen geld._ (**He has no money.**)

**Practice Exercise:**
Convert these sentences into negatives:
-   _Ik heb een kat._ → .............................
-   _Hij is mijn vriend._ → .............................
-   _Wij hebben een auto._ → .............................

#### Asking Questions in Dutch
**Yes/No Questions (Verb-Subject-Object)**
In **Dutch, questions follow a verb-first (VSO) word order**:

| Statement | Question |
| -- | -- |
| _Jij bent student._ (**You are a student.**) | _Ben jij student?_ (**Are you a student?**) | 
| _Hij heeft een auto._ (**He has a car.**) | _Heeft hij een auto?_ (**Does he have a car?**) |

**More examples:**
-   _Werk jij hier?_ (**Do you work here?**)
-   _Spreekt hij Nederlands?_ (**Does he speak Dutch?**)

#### "WH" Questions (Information Questions)
To ask for specific information, we use:

| Dutch | English | Example Question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _Wat_ | What | _Wat is dit?_ (**What is this?**) |
| _Wie_ | Who | _Wie is dat?_ (**Who is that?**) |
| _Waar_ | Where | _Waar woon jij?_ (**Where do you live?**) |
| _Wanneer_ | When | _Wanneer kom jij?_ (**When are you coming?**) |
| _Waarom_ | Why | _Waarom ben jij hier?_ (**Why are you here?**) |
| _Hoe_ | How | _Hoe gaat het?_ (**How are you?**) |

**Practice Exercise:**
Transform these statements into questions:
-   _Jij woont in Rotterdam._ (**You live in Rotterdam.**) → ..........................................................
-   _Zij werkt in een school._ (**She works in a school.**) → ..........................................................
-   _Hij heeft een fiets._ (**He has a bike.**) → ..........................................................

#### Combining Statements, Negations, and Questions
Now let’s practice all three structures together:

Convert each sentence into all three forms:
Statement: _Jij hebt een broer._ (**You have a brother.**)
-   Negative: ..........................................................
-   Question: ..........................................................
Statement: _Wij zijn studenten._ (**We are students.**)
-   Negative: ..........................................................
-   Question: ..........................................................
Statement: _Zij woont in Amsterdam._ (**She lives in Amsterdam.**)
-   Negative: ..........................................................
-   Question: ..........................................................

#### Translation Challenge
Translate the following English sentences into Dutch:
-   I do not have a car.
-   Where do you live?
-   We are happy.
-   He is not my friend.
-   What do you want?

**Wrap-Up**
-   Review key rules: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order, negatives with niet and geen, and forming questions.
-   Try to create three sentences on your own (one positive, one negative, and one question).
-   Reflect: Which part was the easiest? Which was the hardest?

### Lesson 6: Expanding Sentences – Adjectives & Describing People and Things
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn how to use Dutch adjectives to describe people, objects, and places.
-   Understand adjective placement and rules in Dutch grammar.
-   Practice forming descriptive sentences with different adjectives.

#### Understanding Adjective Placement
To ask for specific information, we use:

**What Are Adjectives?**
Adjectives describe nouns. They answer questions like:
-   _Wat voor een boek?_ (**What kind of book?**)
-   _Hoe is het weer?_ (**How is the weather?**)

**Adjective Placement in Dutch**
Unlike English, where adjectives always come **before the noun** (e.g., a red car), Dutch adjectives **change depending on the noun’s grammatical structure**.

1. **Adjective Before a Noun** (Most Common)
The adjective comes **before the noun** and takes an extra "-e" ending if the noun has a definite article (_de_ or _het_).

| Dutch	| English |
| ---- | ---- |
| _Een mooi huis_ | A beautiful house |
| _De mooie auto_ | The beautiful car |
| _Het grote boek_ | The big book |
| Een klein kind	A small child

2. **Adjective Without an "-e" Ending**
If a noun is singular, has _een_ (a), and is a _het_-word, the adjective stays unchanged (no "-e" ending).

| Dutch	| English |
| ---- | ---- |
| _Een mooi huis_	| A beautiful house |
| _Een klein kind_ | A small child |
| _Een groot probleem_ | A big problem |

#### Common Dutch Adjectives
Here are some useful adjectives to describe people, objects, and places:

**Basic Adjectives**
| Dutch | English | Example Sentence |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| _Groot_ | Big | _Het is een groot huis._ (**It is a big house.**) |
| _Klein_ | Small | _De kleine hond speelt._ (**The small dog is playing.**) |
| _Lang_ | Long/Tall | _Hij is een lange man._ (**He is a tall man.**) |
| _Kort_ | Short | _Ik heb kort haar._ (**I have short hair.**) |
| _Mooi_ | Beautiful | _Het is een mooie dag._ (**It is a beautiful day.**) |
| _Lelijk_ | Ugly | _Dit is een lelijk schilderij._ (**This is an ugly painting.**) |
| _Goed_ | Good | _Dit is een goed idee._ (**This is a good idea.**) |
| _Slecht_ | Bad | _Hij heeft een slechte dag._ (**He is having a bad day.**) |
| _Snel_ | Fast | _De snelle auto rijdt hard._ (**The fast car drives fast.**) |
| _Langzaam_ | Slow | _De trein is langzaam._ (**The train is slow.**) |

**Practice Exercise:**
Complete the sentences with the correct adjective:
-   _Ik heb een .......... auto._ (**big**)
-   _Dit is een .......... boek._ (**interesting**)
-   _De .......... kat slaapt._ (**small**)
-   _Mijn vriend heeft een .......... fiets._ (**fast**)
-   _Het is een .......... dag._ (**beautiful**)

**Using Adjectives to Describe People**

**Describing Physical Appearance**
| Dutch | English |
| ---- | ---- |
| Hij is lang. | He is tall. |
| Zij heeft blond haar. | She has blonde hair. |
| Ik heb blauwe ogen. | I have blue eyes. |
| Mijn broer is sterk. | My brother is strong. |

**Describing Personality**
| Dutch	| English |
| ---- | ---- |
| _Zij is vriendelijk._ | She is friendly. |
| _Mijn vader is slim._ | My father is smart. |
| _Hij is grappig._ | He is funny. |

#### Practice Exercise:
Translate These Sentences into Dutch
-   My friend is tall and strong.
-   The teacher is funny and smart.
-   She has long, brown hair.
-   This book is interesting.
-   The house is small but beautiful.

#### Challenge
Now, **try forming your own sentences** using the adjectives from the lesson. Write 3 sentences describing:
-   A person you know.
-   An object in your room.
-   A place you like.

**Wrap-Up**
-   Review aloud: Say 5 sentences using adjectives.
-   Reflection: Which adjectives do you find easiest to remember?
-   Preview for next lesson: Next, we will learn about colors, opposites, and how to use "_er is / er zijn_" (**there is / there are**)!

### Lesson 7: Colors, Opposites, and _Er is / Er zijn_ (There is / There are)
---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn **colors** in Dutch and how to describe objects with them.
-   Understand common opposites to expand descriptive vocabulary.
-   Master _er is / er zijn_ (**there is / there are**) to describe existence.
