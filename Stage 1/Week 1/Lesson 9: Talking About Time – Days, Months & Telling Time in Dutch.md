#### Months & Seasons in Dutch
**Why Is It Important?**  
Talking about dates and months helps you schedule meetings, plan holidays, and talk about the past or future. Dutch months are similar to English, so they’re easy to learn.

#### Telling Time in Dutch
**Structure Overview**
- Dutch uses both **12-hour** and **24-hour** systems.
- Colloquial Dutch often uses **relative time** (like "half past" or "quarter to").

### **Key Vocabulary**
-   _Uur_ – hour  
-   _Minuut_ – minute  
-   _Halve_ – half  
-   _Kwart_ – quarter  
-   _Over_ – past  
-   _Voor_ – to  
-   _Tijd_ – time  

#### Telling the Time: Examples
| Dutch                         | English                     |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| _Het is één uur._               | It is one o’clock.          |
| _Het is kwart over twee._       | It is quarter past two.     |
| _Het is half drie._             | It is half past two. (literally: half *of* three) |
| _Het is kwart voor vier._       | It is quarter to four.      |
| _Het is tien over vijf._        | It is ten past five.        |
| _Het is twintig voor zes._      | It is twenty to six.        |

> **Important:** _“Half drie”_ means 2:30, not 3:30! It literally means "half of three."

#### The 24-Hour Clock
Common in public transport, schedules, and formal settings.
| Dutch          | English       |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| _Het is 14:00 uur._ | It is 2:00 PM.    |
