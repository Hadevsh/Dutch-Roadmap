---
**Lesson Goals:**
-   Learn how to count from 1 to 20 and understand the basics of Dutch numbering.
-   Familiarize yourself with the names of the days of the week and their pronunciation.
-   Practice using numbers and days in sentences to develop fluency.

Dutch numbers are often similar to English ones, but pronunciation can be tricky for beginners. Here’s a guide to the numbers from 1 to 20:

| Number | Dutch | Pronunciation |
| ------ | ----- | ------------- |
| 1 | _Eén_ | "Ayn" |
| 2 | _Twee_ | "Tway" |
| 3 | _Drie_ | "Dree" |
| 4 | _Vier_ | "Veer" |
| 5 | _Vijf_ | "Fayf" |
| 6 | _Zes_ | "Zes" |
| 7 | _Zeven_ | "ZAY-ven" |
| 8 | _Acht_ | "Acht" (with guttural 'ch') |
| 9 | _Negen_ | "NAY-ghen" |
| 10 | _Tien_ | "Teen" |
| 11 | _Elf_ | "Elf" |
| 12 | _Twaalf_ | "Twaalf" |
| 13 | _Dertien_ | "DAIR-teen" |
| 14 | _Veertien_ | "VEER-teen" |
| 15 | _Vijftien_ | "FAYF-teen" |
| 16 | _Zestien_ | "ZES-teen" |
| 17 | _Zeventien_ | "ZAY-ven-teen" |
| 18 | _Achttien_ | "Acht-teen" |
| 19 | _Negentien_ | "NAY-ghen-teen" |
| 20 | _Twintig_ | "TWIN-tig" |

**Key Observations:**
1.   Notice the pattern from 13 to 19: the first part of the number (_der, veer, vijf_) corresponds to the base number, followed by _-tien_.
2.   The number 20 (_twintig_) introduces a pattern for higher numbers, where _-tig_ is the suffix for tens (e.g., _dertig_ = 30).

The days of the week in Dutch are similar to Germanic languages and often end in _-dag_. Here’s a table with pronunciation:

| Day | Dutch | Pronunciation | Meaning/Context |
| --- | ----- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Monday | _Maandag_ | "MAHN-dahg" | Derived from the moon (_maan_). |
| Tuesday | _Dinsdag_ | "DINZ-dahg" | Related to the Norse god Tyr. |
| Wednesday | _Woensdag_ | "VOONS-dahg" | "Wodan’s day" (Odin). |
| Thursday | _Donderdag_ | "DON-der-dahg" | Named after Thor (_donder_ = thunder). |
| Friday | _Vrijdag_ | "FRY-dahg" | "Freya’s day" (Norse goddess). |
| Saturday | _Zaterdag_ | "ZAH-ter-dahg" | Refers to Saturn (_zaterdag_). |
| Sunday | _Zondag_ | "ZON-dahg" | "Sun-day" (_zon_ = sun). |

**Key Observations:**
1.   Each day ends with _-dag_ (day), which makes them easier to remember.
2.   The pronunciations are logical but can vary slightly by region.

**Numbers in Context:**
1.   _Ik heb twee appels._ – I have two apples.
2.   _De trein vertrekt om negen uur._ – The train leaves at nine o'clock.
3.   _Ik ben zestien jaar oud._ – I am sixteen years old.

**Days in Context:**
1.   _Vandaag is maandag._ – Today is Monday.
2.   _Ik werk op woensdag._ – I work on Wednesday.
3.   _Het weekend is zaterdag en zondag._ – The weekend is Saturday and Sunday.

**Wrap-up**
-   Review numbers 1–20 and days of the week aloud.
-   Practice forming your own sentences with numbers and days.
-   Reflect on your progress: Are the pronunciation and patterns becoming clearer?
