#### The Basics of Articles
**Definite Articles** ("the")
| Dutch | English | Used With               |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| *de*      | the         | Most **common nouns**, **people**, **animals**, **professions** |
| *het*     | the         | **Diminutives**, **infinitives used as nouns**, many **abstract or neutral** things |

> Note: There’s no **logical rule** for all nouns – **gender in Dutch is learned with the noun**.

**Indefinite Article** ("a / an")
| Dutch | English |
|-----------|-------------|
| *een*     | a / an      |

> *een* never changes, regardless of *de* or *het*.
